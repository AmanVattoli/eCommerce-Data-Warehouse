## Project Overview

This project implements a star schema data warehouse for an e-commerce business with the following components:
- Dimension tables for customers, products, stores, dates, and loyalty program information
- Fact table for orders
- Data quality checks and updates
- Comprehensive analysis queries
- Tableau visualizations


## Data Model

The data warehouse follows a star schema design with:

### Fact Table
- `FactOrders`: Contains order transactions with measures like quantity, amounts, and costs

### Dimension Tables
- `DimCustomers`: Customer information and demographics
- `DimProducts`: Product catalog with categories and pricing
- `DimStores`: Store locations and details
- `DimDates`: Date dimension for time-based analysis
- `DimLoyaltyInfo`: Customer loyalty program details
